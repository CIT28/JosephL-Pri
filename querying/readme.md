 **Week 1 Querying Part 1**

## Why move from spreddsheet
-We moved to better store large amounts of data and the ablity to speedliy look it up.

## Terms and other 
-There isnt many DMBS ive heard about that use SQL besides mysql. This is all new to me so im learning about new ones each day. 


## What is *SQL*
    1. Sql is a coding langue that uses databases. That is what i assumes it is.My understanding is it a very simple language.

    2.But it actually does more than that. It can create ,read and update data in a data base. This doesnt feel very simple anymore.
