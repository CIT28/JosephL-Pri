 **Week 1 Querying Part 1**

## Why move from spreddsheet
-We moved to better store large amounts of data and the ablity to speedliy look it up.

## Terms and other 
-There isnt many DMBS ive heard about that use SQL besides mysql. This is all new to me so im learning about new ones each day. 


## What is *SQL*
    1. Sql is a coding langue that uses databases. That is what i assumes it is.My understanding is it a very simple language.

    2.But it actually does more than that. It can create ,read and update data in a data base. This doesnt feel very simple anymore.

# "My Thoughts"
### If Im honest, I was struggling at the beginning but I feel better having re-watched some videos and redoing the code alongs. This lesson was a bit easier for me. I didnt feel as lost as I did before. I know my skills have a long way to go. But Im starting to feel more confindent about what Im doing and what each commands does. This code along felt like evrything we were learning coming together.
